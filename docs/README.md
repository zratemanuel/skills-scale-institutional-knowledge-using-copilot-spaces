# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documents. This README provides a concise overview of our approach and direct links to the detailed guides for each stage of project execution.

## Brief Overview
OctoAcme delivers cross-functional projects using a customer-first, iterative, and data-driven approach. The lifecycle we follow is:

- Initiation — validate the problem, align stakeholders, and define success criteria.
- Planning — break work into shippable increments, estimate effort, identify dependencies, and map milestones.
- Execution & Tracking — use project boards, small PRs, automated CI, regular demos, and clear escalation paths for blockers.
- Risk Management & Communication — maintain a risk register and communicate status and incidents transparently.
- Release & Deployment — follow standardized checklists, run pre-release checks, and verify after deployments with rollback plans.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement — capture learnings and convert them into tracked action items.
- Roles & Personas — clearly defined responsibilities for PM, PdM, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders.

These docs are intended as the canonical place to find process guidance, checklists, and templates for running projects at OctoAcme.
