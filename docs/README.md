# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documents. This README provides a concise overview of our approach and direct links to the detailed guides for each stage of project execution.

## Quick Overview

OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects with a customer-first, iterative, and data-driven approach. The lifecycle we follow is:

- Initiation — validate the problem, align stakeholders, and define success criteria.
- Planning — break work into shippable increments, estimate effort, map milestones, and surface risks.
- Execution & Tracking — use project boards, small PRs, automated CI, regular demos, and escalation paths to keep delivery moving.
- Risk Management & Communication — keep a risk register, communicate status regularly, and use templates for weekly and incident updates.
- Release & Deployment — follow standardized checklists, run pre-release checks, and verify after deploys with rollback plans.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement — capture learnings and convert them into tracked action items.
- Roles & Personas — clearly defined responsibilities for PM, PdM, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders.

These docs are intended as the canonical place to find process guidance, checklists, and templates for running projects at OctoAcme.
